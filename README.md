This app is created for challenging This app is created for challenging, the idea is implemented, needs to fix some bugs regarding the data storage, because of time lacking I couldn't use firebase storage to store it, instead of it I used the local storage, it will be fine since it is only for testing.

Uploading an image from the gallery or from the camera is also implemented.

For Google Maps, the tracking needs more setup on the drivers' app, I added the Google Maps and locating Aument on it.

Sign up, Log in, and Log out all implemented using firebase authentication.

Creating options and variations also implemented, the part of the check box and radio buttons must be implemented on the client's app.

Two values must be specified per option before start adding the variations, which are Min/Max: minimum and maximums number of variations the clients can choose for each option, for example: Size 0/1 optional to select any, and if he would like to select he couldn't select more than 1 variant.

Topping 1/7 select at least one topping either from all 7 variants or at max 7 from all listed variants.

Your choice from protein 1/1 selects only one e.g(meat or chicken).

Provider used to refresh the home page when you click add options button (it saves the item before navgiating to the options screen)
